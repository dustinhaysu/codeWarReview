# codeWarReview

This repository is where I am reviewing all code war problems I have previously worked on. Every time I do a code war I put the request and a refactored answer on a Anki card. when a code war question comes up on my deck I will punch in my code here. Sometimes I note out my code other times I delete it completely. this is my scratch pad so don't look into anything too deep because it is likely a mess!
